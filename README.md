# Give Love Back — Ecommerce Demo

This is a minimal, high-contrast ecommerce experience built with Next.js. It features a typographic hero with a subtle particle background, an auto-rotating gallery, a clean store grid, and a lightweight mini-cart.

## Run locally
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open http://localhost:3000 (or the port shown in the terminal)

## Design tokens
Global design tokens live in `app/globals.css` under `:root`:
- `--bg`, `--fg`, `--muted`, `--line`, `--card`
- `--accent`, `--accent-contrast`
- `--radius`, `--shadow-*`, `--trans-*`
Adjusting these will propagate through the app's components.

## Assets
Place product images inside the `assets/` folder at the repository root. The app expects these filenames:
- `bestipink.jpg`
- `bestiepurple.jpg`
- `classicblack.jpg`
- `classicwhite.jpg`
- `totebag.jpg`
- `truckerblack.jpg`
- `truckerwhite.jpg`
If some files are missing, the app will still run but product images will show as broken images. Add the image files you already have to the `assets/` folder.

## Notes
- The cart state is stored in `localStorage`.
- Checkout/payment is not implemented — it's a demo.
- Page transitions are powered by Framer Motion; the rotating gallery uses Swiper.

GLB misson
To be more than a clothing brand, to become a movement that redefines fashion as an act of care, connection, and self expression. To make a difference one garment at a time. GLB envisions a world where wearing our clothes is a way of carrying love into every space you walk into.

Our vision 
GLB is a brand built on collaboration and community. We don’t just create clothing , we want to create spaces where other brands, creatives, and voices can shine too. That’s how we give love back. We believe that fashion should not only express individuality but also create room for community. GLB stands for a culture where giving love back means growing together, not alone.

Our Story.

GLB started with four friends, four young men with big dreams, and one simple question: How can we create something meaningful together? Each of us brought something unique to the table, one with a love for graphic design, another who could craft stories and content, another who could organize and make things happen and one who had an eye for opportunity.

We didn’t want to start just another clothing brand. We wanted something personal, something that reflected who we are and what we value. Something with a story, a shared passion, and a quality we all carry: love. We wanted to give the world what we hold most dear through our creativity, skills, and dedication.

GLB is more than a brand, it’s our story, our friendship, and our dream made real. It’s proof that when you combine your talents with heart, courage, and love, you can create something that inspires, connects, and leaves a mark on the world.
